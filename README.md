## Technology Stack
| Technology | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Python** | Primary programming language used for development. |
| **LangChain** | Framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). |
| **Vectara** | Provides efficient vector search capabilities via the Boomerang model in a "RAG as a service" architecture. |
| **intfloat/multilingual-e5-large** | Generates efficient and performant multilingual language embeddings. |
| **Together AI** | Platform for training, fine-tuning, and deploying gen AI models. Its inference API was used with the model `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`. |
| **Streamlit** | Open-source Python library for creating custom web apps, used as the frontend. |
| **Hugging Face Spaces** | Service for developer-friendly deployments of data applications. |

The backend is built using Python, LangChain, Vectara, and Together AI's inference API with the `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1` model for processing and understanding large amounts of data. Streamlit is used for the frontend, providing an intuitive interface for users. Hugging Face Spaces simplifies the deployment process, making the application easily accessible.
